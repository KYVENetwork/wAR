## How it works

### $AR to $wAR

A user first deposits $AR to the bridge Arweave wallet.
Once the deposit has mined, the bridge will pick it up and mint the appropriate amount of $wAR to the provided Ethereum address.
This is made possible via an [ownable ERC20 contract](contracts/contracts/wAR.sol).

### $wAR to $AR

A user first burns their $wAR by interacting with the ERC20 contract.
Once the burn has mined, the bridge will pick it up and transfer the appropriate amount of $AR to the provided Arweave address.

## Interacting with the bridge

To interact with the bridge you can either use the UI (WIP) or manually
send a transaction to the wallet provided by the bridge. When sending an
$AR transaction make sure to use the following tags:

```
Application: wAR - DEV
Wallet: [YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS]
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Test on [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
- [ ] Test on [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io), etc.
- [ ] Deploy on Ethereum mainnet.
- [ ] Build a UI for easy usage.

_Disclaimer: KYVE will not run the bridge. We are only providing the technical solution
for $wAR._
